# Kaggle_M5_Competition

This repository contains my submission to the M5 Forecasting - Accuracy competition found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy). A brief description of the project was taken from the website and described below:

In this competition, the fifth iteration, you will use hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.
